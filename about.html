          <h2>ABOUT</h2>
          <p>Reasons to live isn't just a house music producer and DJ - he's a musical optimist with a heartbeat at 124 BPM. 
          <br>With a simple yet powerful motto - "I'm here to make you dance!" - he crafts tracks that fuse feeling with movement, soul with groove. His sound lives in the sweet spot between deep basslines and sunlit synths, always with a smile underneath.
          <br><br>His inspiration? The joy of everyday moments. A spontaneous kitchen dance. Laughter on a city sidewalk at sunset. That magical instant at 3:12 AM when everything on the dancefloor feels possible. Reasons to live draws from both daily delight and late-night euphoria, dreaming of playing for everyone - from families in creative neighborhoods to queer crowds on foggy Berlin floors.
          <br><br>To him, the dancefloor is sacred - a space for freedom, connection, and shared joy. A modern ritual where we're allowed to be vulnerable, powerful, and alive, together.
          <br><br>When he's not in the studio or behind the decks, you'll likely find him near water. He swims year-round, saunas in storms or sunshine, embracing nature's extremes. It's in that contrast - heat and cold, light and shadow - that his sound finds balance: soft pads meet hard kicks, introspection dances with ecstasy.
          <br><br>Reasons to live makes house music that's inclusive, infectious, and full of life. His beats invite you in, lift you up, and whisper in your ear:
          <br>There are always reasons to dance.
